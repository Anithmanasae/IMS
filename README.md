INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is aimed at developing an online Sales and Inventory Management System (SIMS) for a departmental store. This system can be used to store the details of the inventory, update the inventory based on the sale details, produce receipts for sales, generate sales and inventory reports periodically etc.

This is one integrated system that contains both the user component (used by salespersons, sales managers, inventory managers etc) and the admin component (used by the administrators for performing admin level functions such as adding new items to the inventory, changing the price of an item etc). 

Administration level Functionality is improved so that it helps the decision-making capabilities of the organization for more efficient output.
